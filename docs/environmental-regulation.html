<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Environmental Regulation</h1>
<!-- Any given problem associated with a market failure can have multiple solutions, which are manifested through regulations of some sort. The challenge, often, is to identify the best of those solutions, i.e., the most effective regulation. The way to go about it is to decide, what is it that we, as a society, are trying to achieve. Economists are often ``blamed'' for offering solutions that can be viewed more as a foe rather than a friend of the environment. The real culprit, however, is society (i.e., group of individuals) and their preferences. For example, if a majority of individuals prefer spending weekends in front of the TV (instead of, say, hiking in the wilderness), then a modest estimate of the willingness-to-pay for wilderness protection should come as no surprise. -->
<!-- <!-- There are two issues here: (i) how do individuals view the environment, and (ii) how do we consolidate those individual opinions to create the view of the society as a whole. -->
<!-- ## Rationale for Regulation -->
<!-- Environmental (or, more broadly, economic) regulation involves the government intervening in the private actions of firms and individuals. Two basic theories of regulation are the *public interest theory*, and the *interest group theory*. -->
<!-- The public interest theory of regulation is a normative theory. It views the purpose of regulation as the promotion of public interest. Three general reasons for the regulation to exist: imperfect competition, imperfect information, and externalities. -->
<!-- - Imperfect competition: the role of government is to control prices in order to protect consumers from monopoly pricing, and in some instances---i.e., in the case of natural monopoly---to restrict the entry of new firms. -->
<!-- - Imperfect information: the role of government may be to establish a set of liability rules to facilitate, say, the provision of quality (passive or indirect intervention), or to specify acceptable levels of quality (active or direct intervention). -->
<!-- - Externalities: the usual approach for government is to define a set of institutions and regulations to govern the provision of public bads and negative externalities. -->
<!-- The interest group theory of regulation is a positive theory. It views the purpose of regulation as the promotion of the narrow interests of particular groups in society, and maintains that *rent seeking* is the primary rationale for regulation. Rent Seeking involves private individuals or firms using the government to guarantee extra benefits (rents) through government-mandated restriction on economic activity. -->
<!-- ## Basic Regulatory Instruments -->
<!-- Most environmental regulations fall into two broad categories: *prescriptive regulations* (also referred as *command-and-control*) and *economic incentives*.  -->
<!-- ### Prescriptive Regulation -->
<!-- Command-and-control is the dominant form of environmental regulation in the world. Its fundamental principle is for the regulator to specify the steps individuals or firms must take to mitigate/solve the environmental problem. There are two basic types of prescriptive regulations: *technology standards* and *performance standards*. Technology standards typically specify a particular type of equipment that must be used. Performance standards typically stipulate the maximum emissions allowed per unit of economic activity. This is a more flexible method of regulation, which typically leads to improved cost-effectiveness (at least compared to that of a technology standard). 	 -->
<!-- Often, a regulation combines performance standards with technology standards. Prescriptive regulations may, in fact, be combined with fines and penalties associated with noncompliance, which are different from (and should not be confused with) economic incentives to abate pollution. -->
<!-- Two key features that distinguish prescriptive regulations from economic incentives are: (i) restricted choice for the polluter as to what means to be used to achieve an appropriate environmental target, and (ii) a lack of mechanisms for equalizing marginal control costs among several different polluters.  -->
<!-- The advantage of prescriptive regulations is in greater certainty in the pollution levels, as well as in simplifying monitoring of compliance with a regulation. The disadvantages to prescriptive regulations are: (i) cost (costliness) of administering the regulation; (ii) reduced incentives (for a firm) to find better ways to control pollution; and (iii) not accounting for residual damage from the pollution that is still emitted after controls are in place; (iv) difficulty in satisfying the *equimarginal principle*. For the equimarginal principle to be satisfied, in controlling emissions from several polluters, marginal cost of emission control must be the same for all polluters. -->
<!-- ### Incentive--Based Regulation -->
<!-- Economic incentives, in contrast to prescriptive regulations, provide rewards to potential polluters to do what is perceived to be in public interest.   -->
<!-- Three basic types of economic incentives are: *emission fees*, *marketable permits*, and *liability*.  -->
<!-- Emission fees involve the payment of a charge per unit of pollution emitted.   -->
<!-- It then becomes in a polluter's interest to reduce emissions.  -->
<!-- Marketable permits allow polluters to buy and sell the right to pollute. -->
<!-- By enabling the trade of permits, something of similar character to a prescriptive regulation (a permit to pollute) becomes an economic incentive. The marketable permit system is often referred as cap--and--trade, in that the regulator sets a cap on overall emissions, and allows trading among polluters to determine who emits what. Trading induces a price or value on a permit to pollute. -->
<!-- Liability is based on a simple concept: if you harm someone, you must compensate that person for damage. Importantly, the regulator does not prescribe a polluter any action, rather it enforces the responsibility for consequences. -->
<!-- The advantages of incentive-based regulations (over prescriptive regulations) are: (i) mitigated informational requirements; (ii) enhanced incentives to innovate; (iii) polluter paying for control costs as well as pollution damage; and (iv) equimarginal principle holds for most types of economic incentives. -->
<!-- The disadvantages to economic incentives are: (i) difficulty in developing incentive--based regulations that efficiently and perfectly address the complexities of environmental transformation; (ii) administrative/bureaucratic difficulties in adjusting the level of incentives in accord with the new information; (iii) political challenges to instituting emission fees, as they, in essence, facilitate the wealth transfer from firms to the government. -->
<!-- ## Incentive--Based Policies -->
<!-- Normally, consumer preferences for goods are communicated to producers through the price system. This link is "broken" in the case of environmental bads, because polluters' production function does not account for the damage caused by their emissions. The simplest  way to correct this is to establish an \textit{emission fee}---a price paid by a polluter to a regulatory entity for every unit of emission. -->
<!-- Consider a firm that produces some good, $x$, and in the process emits pollution, $e$. Let $C(e)$ denote the firm's costs associated with emission. In particular, $C(e)$ is a decreasing function of $e$. That is, the firm's costs (or efforts) to reduce pollution increase with emission abatement. Further, let $p$ be the emission fee, established by the regulator. So, the payment from the polluter to the regulator is $pe$. Total costs for the firm, thus, are given by the sum of the abatement costs and the fee, associated with $e$ units of emission: $$TC(e) = C(e)+pe$$ -->
<!-- It then follows that at the optimum: $$p=-MC(e^*) = MS(e^*),$$ where $MS(e)$ denotes the marginal savings from emitting one more unit of pollution. When faced with an emission fee, firms will abate pollution up to the point where the marginal savings (or marginal cost of abatement) is equal to the emission fee. Note, the equimarginal principle automatically holds: each firm sets their marginal cost of abatement equal to the same emission fee. -->
<!-- ## Pigovian Fees -->
<!-- A special kind of emission fee, which aims to restore Pareto optimality in the case of market failure, is known as the *Pigovian fee*, after the English economist Arthur C. Pigou. In particulary, a Pigovian fee is an emission fee that is exactly equal to the aggregate marginal damage caused by the emissions when evaluated at the efficient level of pollution. -->
<!-- Suppose a total of $n$ individuals are adversely affected from the pollution emitted by the (aforementioned) firm.  -->
<!-- For person $i$, the damage of pollution is $D_i(e)$, and the total damage is given by the vertical sum of individual damage functions: $$D(e) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}D_i(e)$$ -->
<!-- The efficient amount of pollution is the amount that minimizes the sum of costs and damages from pollution. So, at the optimum: $$MD(e^*) = -MC(e^*)$$ or, equivalently, $$MD(e^*) = MS(e^*),$$ as the marginal savings is the negative of the marginal cost of emission. -->
<!-- The optimal level of pollution is the one for which the marginal abatement cost and the marginal damage are equal.  -->
<!-- The associated price, $p^*$, is the Pigovian fee. -->
<!-- The Pigovian fee is not any emission fee. It is the marginal savings from pollution at the optimal level of pollution.  -->
<!-- With multiple polluters, we typically assume that they are sharing the obligation of emission abatement in an efficient manner. The aggregate marginal savings is the horizontal sum of the individual marginal savings. Thus, for a given emission fee, the aggregate marginal savings tells us how much of pollution will be emitted in total, while the individual marginal savings tell us how much each firm will contribute to that total. -->
<!-- ## Fees vs Subsidies -->
<!-- Is making polluters pay emission fees (taxes) equivalent to paying firms to reduce pollution (subsidies)? -->
<!-- Taxes increases firm's production costs. Therefore, they also raise average costs, and shift the marginal cost curve leftward. Subsidies also shift of the marginal cost curve leftward, but unlike taxes, they lower average costs.  -->
<!-- In the short run, a subsidy may allow firms to continue operating that would not do so in the case of a tax. In the long run, prices of goods will be higher, and there will be less firms in the market, with a tax than with a subsidy.  -->
<!-- ## Imperfect Competition -->
<!-- When markets are not competitive, a host of efficiency problems arise, which, in turn, amplify the issues of environmental regulation. -->
<!-- A case in point will be illustrated using two different scenarios: (i) a monopolist in the goods market that is one of many polluters; and (ii) a competitive firm in the goods market that is the only polluter. -->
<!-- ### Monopolist in the Goods Market -->
<!-- Consider a steel manufacturer that also emits pollution. There are many other polluters in the region, but only one steel manufacturer. In absence of regulation, the monopolist will produce where the marginal revenue and the unregulated marginal costs are equal. -->
<!-- The regulation will shift the marginal cost curve upward, and the firm will produce where the marginal revenue and the regulated marginal costs are equal. Turns out, the emission fee has made matters worse.  -->
<!-- The intuition behind this is simple: a monopolist has already lowered output below the competitive levels (which happen to be larger than the socially optimal levels). The imposition of the emission fee further restricts output, and in so doing may just overdo it. -->
<!-- ### Monopolist in Bads Production -->
<!-- Consider a firm, which is competitive in the goods market, but is a sole emitter of pollution in the region. That is, the firm is a monopolist in emission. The regulator imposes the emission tax, by setting it equal to the marginal damage of pollution. The firm, being able to observe the slope of the marginal damage function, will end up producing at the level that is below the efficient amount of pollution. -->
<!-- <!-- ## Issues of Environmental Regulation -->
<!-- <!-- Location matters. The closer is the source of pollution (say, a factory) to the location of interest (say, a densely populated city), the greater will be the damage from the pollution. -->
<!-- <!-- Time matters. Due to the bio-chemical nature of environmental transformation, the emissions in the evening or at night are less damaging than those in the morning or afternoon. Also, emissions during the winter season are less damaging (low heat / less sunshine) compared to the same amounts of emissions during the summer season. -->
<!-- <!-- Environmental regulations, ideally, would target ambient concentrations rather than emissions, because it is the former that causes damage. But that is usually difficult and often impractical to do. The regulations, instead, apply overall goals regarding desired levels of emission, which are only imperfectly related to optimal levels of ambient concentration, because of the aforementioned spatial and temporal issues, as well as the complexity of the environmental transformation. But even with emission targets, there are better ways and less desirable ways of regulation. Cost effectiveness -- i.e., achieving the emission target at least cost -- is key, because it is usually attainable for many regulations, even though efficiency is not. -->
